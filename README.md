# Method feeder fishing…

**_All anglers at some point have used the Method. And, as a tactic, it’s devastating fish-catching capabilities are well-documented.
It has even been adopted by the specimen world in recent years. But, even though you can buy bespoke Method mixes and purpose-made loading moulds, match-angling legend Nick Speed reckons most anglers are still getting the basics wrong._**

### HYBRID FEEDERS

For us, this is the ultimate feeder as it offers brilliant bait protection on the cast and perfect bait presentation once on the bottom. It really doesn’t get any better than this because it can be used anywhere. Size-wise there are three we recommend – a Mini for short chucks on narrow lakes, often to islands, a Small for general usage on commercial stillwaters, and a Large for big chucks on the bigger venues. Choice of weight depends on the circumstances you are faced with but we always like to opt for a heavier feeder over a lighter one because it’s crucial when fishing the hybrid that the feeder doesn’t move once it’s on the bottom.

### METHOD FEEDERS

The original ‘king of commercials’, the Method feeder has been around for years and is still a firm favourite with many anglers. Since the Hybrid feeder evolved, our customers don’t use them quite as much but they still have their place in our armoury. If you want to attack a swim, there is quite simply nothing better due to the amount of payload a Method feeder can hold. We’re a massive fan of the Guru X-safe feeders mainly because they enable us to use an elasticated feeder safely. We recommend changing to longer stems on the feeders as the extra length of elastic means fewer lost fish, particularly around the net. The longer stem also gives more stability on the cast so it’s easier to cast further and more accurately.

### DISTANCE FEEDERS

When fishing at long range on big, natural waters we like to use the Preston Innovations Distance feeder for fishing between 45m and 70m. These feeders are weight-forward in design so they cast straight and true even in a strong crosswind which helps with accuracy. Size-wise, we recommend using 30g or 40g, but this can vary depending on the conditions and distance you need to reach.
